# Logistic_Regression_project
Task: Create a classification model to predict whether a patient has signs of heart disease, depending on the physical characteristics of that person (age, gender, cholesterol, etc.)
The database contains 14 attributes about physical testing of patients. They donate blood and perform a small physical test. The "goal" column indicates the presence of a heart disease in the patient - 0 means there is no disease, 1 means there is a disease. In general, to confirm 100% heart disease is a very invasive process, so if we can build a model that accurately estimates the likelihood of the disease, it will help to avoid expensive invasive procedures.
